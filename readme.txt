== Why Organize Terms Into Groups? ==

Most WordPress sites mix up terms into one big messy group. In most cases, terms should actually be separated by topics: places, people, features, years and more.

Your term however, will become much more useful if you organize them in groups. Imagine a tag cloud where all places appear in a "Places" group, all names under "Names" and all years under "Years". The Tag Groups plugin lets you do exactly that.

The plugin gives you many term displays. You can also customize them, append or prepend something to each tag. You can add separators, choose the link target, set the smallest and the largest font size, display the post count and much more.

== Does Tag Groups Only Work With Tags? ==

No. Tag Groups works also great with most other (flat) taxonomies, such as WooCommerce product tags.

The plugin does not support hierarchical taxonomies like categories.

== Does Tag Groups Work with Multilingual Websites? ==

Yes, this plugin is officially compatible with **WPML**, the WordPress Multilingual plugin. This means you can use a different tag group name for each language.

== Installation ==

1. Find the plugin in the list at the backend and click to install it. Or, upload the ZIP file through the admin backend. Or, upload the unzipped tag-groups folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

The plugin will create a new menu "Tag Groups" and a submenu "Tag Group Admin" in the Post section (depending on the chosen taxonomy) where you find the tag groups. After you have created some groups, you can edit your tags (or other terms) and assign them to one of these groups. A filter and a bulk action menu are available on the Tags page and you also find a filter on the Posts pages.

The tabbed tag cloud (or an accordion containing the tags) can be inserted with a shortcode or a Gutenberg block. Options are listed under the "Tag Groups" main menu.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Can I Start Using Tag Groups? =

After activating the plugin, you will be guided by an optional **setup wizard**.

First you create groups that will contain your tags. Then you sort your tags into these groups. You can later always come back and modify the groups or change the tags. You don't even need any groups if you prefer to show your tags sorted by alphabet.

Filters and bulk actions make your work with tags much easier, and you can even filter the list of posts in your backend by the groups that their tags belong to.

= What are Possible Applications of Tag Groups? =

* Display your tags grouped by language or by topic.
* Create an alphabetical index of your tags - think of a phone book for your tags.
* Display only tags of selected groups in a tag cloud.
* Choose which tags to display in different sections of your blog.
* Change the sorting order in your tag cloud.
* Customize the links, the text, the font size or the separator of your tag cloud items.
* Prepend or append to each tag a custom character or the post count.
* Insert into each post a tag cloud using only the tags of this post.
* Easily manage huge amounts of tags or posts in the backend by dividing them into groups.
* Add a parent level to tags and make them hierarchical.

= How Can I Show the Tags of Each Post Sorted into Groups? =

Please use one of the shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks that come with the Tag Groups plugin. Since we cannot change the code of templates or other plugins, there is no possibility to make them aware of the new structure where tags are organized in groups.
